    <p>Recently I’ve had somewhat of a sudoku addiction and decided to make a puzzle generator
and solver for my phone using J2ME. The game can generate puzzles with a variety of
difficulties from Novice to Master. The game’s solver can even be used to key in and play
sudoku puzzles that you find in books, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2010/05/17/main-screens.png" alt="Screenshots of main game screens" /></p>

<p>Mobile phones are surprising powerful considering how basic their hardware specs are when
compared with a desktop. I designed the UI of this game to adapt to the size of the phone
display size since they vary drastically. I even added scrolling for older phones that
have really tiny display resolutions.</p>

<p>Since puzzles are generated randomly I thought it would be fun to provide a way for the
player to see the random seed for their puzzle so that they can share it with a friend and
compete to see who can solve the puzzle first. The seed is shown on the paused screen and
can then be input by selecting “Custom” game from the main menu:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2010/05/17/seeds.png" alt="Screenshots of using game seeds" /></p>

<p>Some people (like my friend) like to highlight cells whilst following their train of
thought. I added a utility that allows the player to color cells in:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2010/05/17/tools.png" alt="Screenshot of coloring tool for highlighting cells" /></p>

<p>When solving sudoku puzzles on paper people tend to mark candidate values using pencil
whilst following logic through a puzzle. Pressing a number twice will turn it into a
smaller “pencil mark” inside the cell.</p>

<p>There is a “Hint” sub-menu on the options menu that can be used if you get stuck on a
puzzle. You can get a simple validation to tell you if there are mistakes on the puzzle;
have it automatically fill in all of candidate value markings or straight out peak at a
random cell:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2010/05/17/hints.png" alt="Using hints" /></p>

<p>One of my favorite games “Ratchet and Clank” has various skill points which is basically a
checklist of extra challenges that you can complete. I came up with a series of these
challenges which the player can complete over time. There are even a few particularly
challenging puzzles which are hard-coded in and shown in the skill points list.</p>

<p>The game also keeps track of various statistics which help you to track your progress in
becoming a sudoku master. Puzzle seeds are shown for each notable game so that you can
challenge a friend to the same puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2010/05/17/stats.png" alt="Screenshots of skill point and statistics screens" /></p>

<p>Finally there is the solver screen which allows you to input a puzzle which can then be
played using the phone. There is an option to turn all inputted values into hints so that
they cannot be accidentally erased.</p>

<p>Of course the solver can be used to solve puzzles and will give an indication of the
difficulty and estimated completion time. The estimated completion times are surprisingly
accurate.</p>

<p>For fun I also generated a couple of giant sudoku puzzles by generating a series of
regular size puzzles and then stitching them together. I made an easy one and a hard one
which can be downloaded here (caution the answers are on the last page):</p>
