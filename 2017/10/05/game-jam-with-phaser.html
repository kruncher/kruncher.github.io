    <p>It has been a tough week. My dad passed away after having been ill with Crohn’s disease
for many years. He started to deteriorate quite rapidly recently. It was heart breaking
seeing him on his final days at the hospital.</p>

<p>I decided to have myself a little game jam. The planet is being showered by a mysterious
sentient goop that is taking the world by storm. Goop is very strongly attracted to other
goop and wants to take possession of all of the planet’s lifeforms.</p>

<p>I figured it would be fun try tryout <a href="phaser.io">Phaser</a>, a HTML5 based framework for creating canvas
and WebGL games, since a friend was talking about it recently and I’ve encountered it in
my web travels a few times.</p>

<p>The framework has been quite easy to use and is reasonably well documented. The only issue
that I encountered was that occasionally the screen would flip vertically for a single
frame whilst my transition was happening. After some poking around I found that the world
transforms were being inverted by the framework whilst capturing the display using a
render texture. With some trial-and-error experimentation I found that the problem could
be solved simply by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">world.updateTransform</code> after rendering to the render texture.</p>

<p>The game is an endless runner where pre-defined chunks are chosen at random and then
cycled horizontally. At most there are only ever two chunks which are reused for the
duration of each game:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/10/05/cycling-chunks.png" alt="Illustration of cycling of chunks" /></p>

<p>I designed each of the chunks using the <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> map editor which are then chosen from at
random when populating chunks as they are cycled. The pre-defined chunks are arranged into
sets so that easier ones are encountered early on and then more challanging ones are
introduced as the game progresses. Easier chunks are also removed from circulation as the
game becomes harder.</p>

<p>There are two simple rules that must be followed when designing chunks for this game to
avoid putting Goop into a situation where it cannot move through a wall. Each chunk must
start with a death in the lower-left corner. This prevents the following situation from
occurring between two chunks:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/10/05/chunk-design-pattern.png" alt="Chunk map design pattern" /></p>

<p>There are 5 regular tiles and then 4 marker tiles that are used to spawn interactive
actors. Here is what a chunk looks like in the <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> map editor:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/10/05/chunk-map.png" alt="One of the chunk maps" /></p>

<p>I wrote a simple script using <a href="nodejs.org">Node.js</a> to combine the chunk map data files to reduce them
into a single HTTP request rather than one per chunk map.</p>

<p>I had quite a lot of fun designing the artwork for this little game. As usual I started
of using just placeholder blocks until the game played how I had imagined. I sketched out
how I wanted the background layers to look using <a href="https://procreate.art/">ProCreate</a> on the iPad Pro and then went
around the edges of my sketch in Photoshop using vectors to get a clean sharp look. The
sprites were made entirely in Photoshop using vectors.</p>

<p>The game can be played for free <a href="/">here</a>.</p>
