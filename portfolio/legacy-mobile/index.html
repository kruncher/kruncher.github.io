  <div class="post__content body-content">
    <p>I made a selection of games using Java with the J2ME framework which ran on the older
style of smart phones. This was my first dip into creating software for mobile devices
and whilst none of these were actually released it was a fun learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>

<p>This Sudoku implementation generates puzzles of varying skill levels entirely from scratch
including generation of the completed grid, and removal of numbers such that there is only
one possible solution. I also included a solver with various tools so that players can
attempt to craft their own puzzles by hand or simply if they want to cheat at a magazine
Sudoku puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/legacy-mobile/sudoku.png" alt="Sudoku" /></p>

<p>There are a number of challenges and the game keeps progress of various stats over the
course of all the puzzles they play so that they can monitor their progress. The puzzle
codes for significant accolades can be used to reload the same puzzle again. Multiple
people can play the same puzzle using the code that seeds the generation.</p>

<p>See blog posts for further information:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="checkers">Checkers</h2>

<p>Having made the Sudoku game I realized that the processing power of these old smart phones
was actually pretty decent. So I wanted to see how well they would handle some basic
board game AI. The AI that I wrote presents the player with several difficulties.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/legacy-mobile/checkers.png" alt="Checkers" /></p>

<p>I created the artwork using 3D Studio Max and Photoshop.</p>

<p>See blog post for further information:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="reversi">Reversi</h2>

<p>Following on from the Checkers game I wanted to make another game with board AI. This time
I managed to create an AI that I actually was unable to beat when on highest difficulty.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/legacy-mobile/reversi.png" alt="Reversi" /></p>

<p>Again I created the artwork using 3D Studio Max and Photoshop including the spinning
counter sprite animation.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="mines">Mines</h2>

<p>I had previously created a fully featured mines game for windows which included various
skins; so I figured it would be interesting to port that to J2ME. This gave me a good
oppertunity to learn how the graphics API works in the J2ME framework.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/portfolio/legacy-mobile/mines.png" alt="Mines" /></p>

<h2 id="worm">Worm</h2>

<p>For my first mobile game I just wanted to make something straightforward; so I created a
clone of Snake except I added an easier mode which gives the player a couple of lifes at
the cost of being unable to reach higher scores.</p>
