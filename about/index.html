    <p>My name is Lea Hayes. I was born in 1986 and am extremely passionate about software
engineering and development. I am experienced with managing the engineering function of a
company but also enjoy hands-on design and development. I have worked on applications,
games, websites, and APIs. I am always interested in learning and experimenting with new
things and am always keen to push my skills to the next level.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leading the engineering function of an ed-tech company where I hired and line managed my

  <li>
    <p>Leading the development of several games which are available on the various mobile
markets as well as Steam for desktop releases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working with clients to develop games, websites and tooling to ease development
workflows. This involvement has ranged from design and development; to optimising poor
existing code bases; to porting existing code bases; to diagnosing and fixing issues; to
training; to leading development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development, support, and maintenance of the Rotorz Tile System editor extension for the
Unity game engine for over 6 years which has been used in the prototyping and production

  <li>
    <p>I have developed a number of open source packages which have been used by the developers

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been involved in the BETA testing of the Unity game engine for several years and
have raised a number of issues with repro projects which were recognized and addressed.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-became-interested-in-software-development">How I became interested in software development</h2>

<p>I got my very first computer (a Dragon 32) at age 6 which my grandad gave to me one
weekend when I went to visit him. My dad and I were really taken by this and spent
countless hours playing some fairly tricky arcade games. Whilst a couple of the games that
we had were on cassette tape, most of them were just source listings in books that we
would have to manually key in each time that we wanted to play them. At the time neither
of us understood any of the code but we had a lot of fun trying to get these games to
actually work.</p>

<p>My dad bought me my first PC (an Intel 486) a couple of years later with a point-and-click
game creation program called <em>Klik &amp; Play</em> which was the first in a series of game
development tools by <em>Clickteam</em>. Over the next 5 or so years my and my dad created quite
a number of games using these tools in conjunction with other content creation tools such
as 3D Studio Max, Photoshop, etc.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/dad-game-screenshots.png" class="block-image-link"><img src="/assets/img/dad-game-screenshots.png" alt="Screenshots of some of the games that my father and I made" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Some of the games that my father and I worked together on when I was a kid in the 90s.</p>

<p>I started to become curious as to how software worked and an old friend of the family
introduced me to Visual Basic. My dad bought me some pretty chunky books so that I could
learn how to create my own software. I stuck with Visual Basic for several years and then
when we got the Internet I started to become aware of other programming languages and
started to learn C and C++.</p>

<p>After senior school I went to college to study computing with a focus on software
development. My course tutors were very good in allowing me to focus on more complex and
interesting topics whilst still fulfilling the requirements of the syllabus. I graduated
college and moved on to study games and software development at university.</p>

<p>After university I worked down the family camera store to help them through hard times
and so was unable to begin my development on a professional level. Although this didn’t
stop me from exercising my skills in my free time.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies-and-interests">Hobbies and Interests</h2>

<p>I enjoy playing difficult games like Dark Souls and Hollow Knight with friends; we
challenge each other to complete specific runs. I personally enjoy hardcore (aka permadeath
or one-life) playthroughs because it forces me to play more carefully… death can be just
around the corner at any time!</p>

<p>Whilst playing games I will typically watch and interact with a couple of close knit
communities on Twitch where I am also moderator. Twitch is an amazing community and I have
met some really amazing people on there.</p>

<p>I really enjoy being creative and pushing myself wherever possible with graphics creation.
At the time of writing I am creating a 3D character model with Blender using the Adobe
Mixamo service to automatically rig and apply animations. My “arting” skills are by no
means as strong as my development skills but I am always looking to advance them.</p>

<p>Nothing pleases me more than to help get friends started with software development. I find
it incredibly rewarding to see other people creating amazing things using knowledge that I
have shared with them.</p>
